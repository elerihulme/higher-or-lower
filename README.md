## User Experience Design

### Strategy

#### User Experience

 
#### User Expectations


#### User Stories



### Scope

#### Existing Features


#### Future Features



### Structure

#### User Flow diagram

This diagram shows how the user may interact and navigate through the website

### Skeleton

#### Wireframes


##### Mobile


##### Tablet


##### Desktop


### Surface

#### Colours

The following colours have been used to add interesting backgrounds to site sections, with white (#FFF) as a contrasting colour, which is also used for all text:


#### Typography

Fonts were chosen from Google Fonts:
  
- [Marcellus](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marcellus) was used for H1 and H2 tags.
- [Pontano Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pontano+Sans) was used for all other body text.

#### Media

All images used on the site have been taken from the Older & Wider podcast [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/olderandwiderpodcast) page and [merchandise website](https://olderandwidershop.com).

For the image carousels that appear on index.html and about.html, I used [RespImageLint](https://ausi.github.io/respimagelint/) to advise about creating alternates for all images, that would be appropriate at different screens sizes. This was then implemented using the HTML `img` `srcset` attribute for each image used.



## Testing



## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The site was deployed using GitHub Pages, as follows:

- Navigate to the GitHub repository.
- Click 'Settings'.
- Under 'Code and automation', select 'Pages'.
- On the 'GitHub Pages' section, under 'Build and deployment > Source' select 'Deploy from a branch'.
- Ensure that the 'main' branch has been selected, and then click 'Save'.
