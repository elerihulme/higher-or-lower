##### Header

![Header desktop screen shot](documentation/header-desktop.png)

* The header is always visible on the webpage to provide consistnecy throughout the game.
* The header consists of the game title "Higher or Lower ?" 
* The header is responsive. When on a small screen the title extends over two lines instead of one

![Header mobile screen shot](documentation/header-mobile.png)

##### Footer

![Footer desktop screen shot](documentation/footer-desktop.png)

* The footer is always visible on the webpage to provide consistency throughout the game.
* The footer consists of the GitHub logo and my GitHub user game and is a link to my GitHub page.
* The logo and username change colour when the mouse hovers them, to indicate to the user that the text and icon are a clickable link.
* The link opens in a new tab so the user doesn't have any issues finding the game again.
* The footer content already compatible with all device sizes as the content is minimal and easily fits the width of all standard screen sizes.

##### Start Section

![Start section desktop screen shot](documentation/start-section-desktop.png)

* The start section consists of two buttons: 
 - 'Start Game': which takes the user to the game section .
 - 'How To Play': which opens the how to play modal.
* This gives the user two options: to start playing the game straight away, or to learn how to play the game first.
* The start sections is compatible with all screen sizes as the button are positioned one on top of the other. They are not too wide to fit inside the width of a mobile device, and are not to too tall or spaced out so they are both visible in the device viewport together.

![Start section mobile screen shot](documentation/start-section-mobile.png)

##### Game Section

![Game section desktop screen shot](documentation/game-section-desktop.png)

* The game section consists of:
 - 'How To Play Button"
 - A line of text indicating which round the user is currently on. This is automatically set to one at the start of each game and increases with each successful guess.
 - A line of text inofrming the user the range of numbers that are availble for the cards to hekp them make an informed guess.
 - A line of text that helps guide the user through the game by providing instructions about what they should do next and updates about their progress.
 - Five boxes which are the 'cards' used for playing the game. 
 - A higher and a lower button that allow the user to make their guess.
 - A reset button that allows the user to reset the game at any point during the game

* Initally only the first card has a number shown, the others are all marked with a '?', and the numbers get revealled one by one as the user makes guesses, adn the background turns from blue to either green or red to indicate to the user whether their guess was correct or incorrect.
* All buttons have a hover effect to ensure the user knows that they are interactive and clickable. However, the higher and lower buttons are diabled and the hover effect removed when the user guesses incorrectly, to show that the game is over.

### Surface

#### Colours

![Color pallet](documentation/higher-or-lower-colour-palette.png)

- The main theme colours were Argentinian Blue (#35A7FF) and Carrot Orange (#F39237) to create a loud and bright colour scheme to make the game look exciting and engaging to the user.
- Dark Blue (#1F01B9) was then used as border for each card to clearly define each card.
- Sky Blue (#87CEEB) was used initally as the background for each card to make the cards easily readable and as a neutral colour before they were truned Lime Green or Red so the user can quickly and easily tell if they were right or wrong as green is typically associated with correct and red with incorrect.

#### Typography

![New Amsterdam Font](documentation/new-amsterdam.png)

- Google font's 'New Amsterdam' was used for the headings and buttons as the block capitals look similar to the fonts used in retro games, making the website look instantly like a game so the user may quickly have a sense of the webpage's purpose.

![Nunito Font](documentation/nunito.png)

- Google font's 'Nunito' was used for any instructional text as the spacing and clarity of the letters makes the text easy to read and therefore will help the user understand any information easily.

## Testing

### Validation

* [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was run the page to determine any HTML errors.
The only error found was a warning that there wasn't a heading element as the direct child of a section for the start and game sections.
However, there are cases where this is acceptable, paticularly in the case of links or buttons.
More information can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section)

![html validation](documentation/html-validator.png)

* [CSS Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was run on the style sheet and there were no errors found.

![css validation](documentation/css-validator.png)

* Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools was used to check performance.

![lighthouse report](documentation/lighthouse-report.png)

* [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was run on the JavaScript code and there were no errors found.

### Compatibility and Responsiveness

The website was tested on Chrome, Mozilla, Edge and Safari browsers with no problems found.

The website was tested on numerous sized screens including different desktop, tablet and mobile devices and was found to respond as expected to all sizes.

### Bugs

#### Solved Bugs

Bug 1:
When randomly selecting 5 number between 0 and 15 for the game.cards array it was possible for the same number to appear consecutively, and therefore neither higher or lower would be correct, making it impossible for the user to win.

Solution:
Instead of using a for loop which concluded after 5 iterations producing 5 numbers, a while loop was used and set to run until 5 numbers were pushed to the game.cards array and numbers were only pushed to the array if they were not already included in the array therefore no duplicate numbers would be present. In the game it makes it seem like there is only one of each card and therefore the same number could not appear twice. This  means the user always has a chance of being correct.

Bug 2:
When the user would guess incorrectly the game was still allowing them keep playing allowing them to change they're guess and always win.

Solution:
I added the game status key to the game object which would have the vale of either active or inactive and after an incorrect guess the game status was set to inactive the game would no longer process the user's guess meaning that they were unable to play the game until the game had been reset, setting the game status back to active.
